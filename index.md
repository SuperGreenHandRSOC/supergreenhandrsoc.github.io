## 🦉Jinjing Zhuge / Antares
‍**Jinjing Zhuge** is an undergraduate student majored in Artificial Interlligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).Her research interests include **LLM Agents**, **AI safety**, and the fascinating intersection between **AI and cognitive science**.

When not immersed in research, she might be designing software tools to make everyday lift a bit smarter, pondering minds and models, or creating ACG-style digital art. Feel free to say hi—especially if you're also trying to teach machines to think twice.

She plans to share thoughts, projects, and musings on her [personal blog](https://sharks-pears-blog.vercel.app/)—currently under construction, but coming soon!
